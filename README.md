# Loan_Default_Classification
This project classifies whether a given loan will be defaulted or not. I have used multiple classificaiton techniques - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoosting and compared the results from them. Also this project explains how feature engineering works.
