# Loan_Default_Classification
This project classifies whether a given loan will be defaulted or not. I have used multiple classificaiton techniques - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoosting and compared the results from them. This is my academic project which I made during my Masters in Business Analytics at NMIMS. Ill be adding each of these incrementally to the git
<p>
Also this project explains how feature engineering works.
I'll soon be adding explainations of the EDAs and how features have been dropped or selected and how data has been transformed to be passed into ML models
